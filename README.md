# CodaSession
In simple words, CodaSession is like GoogleDocs for programmers. 
It allows you to work collaboratively on code with fellow engineers - no matter
where you live. For communication, CodaSession allows users to use a chat window.
Furthermore, it is very easy to exchange ideas via integrated video calls.

> CodaSession is meant to reduce barriers for effective remote work.
